# Getting and Cleaning data - Peer-Graded Programming Assignment

### Data description
The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

### Code explaination
The code combined training dataset and test dataset,  and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

### New dataset
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

# This repository contains 3 main files:


run_analysis.R - This script is used to build up and perform the analysis on the required sample data.

tidy_data.txt - This is the final output from the run_analysis.R script.  It contains a cleansed version of the sample data.

CodeBook.md - Contains the definitions of each of the columns in our generated tidy.txt file.
